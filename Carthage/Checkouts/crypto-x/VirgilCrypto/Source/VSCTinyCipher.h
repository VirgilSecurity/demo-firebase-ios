/**
 This class aim is to minimize encryption output.
 
 Motivation: Minimize encryption output.
 
 Solution: Throw out crypto agility and transfer minimum public information required for decryption.
 
 Pros:
    - Tiny messages.
 
 Cons:
    - Crypto agility is not included in the message, so encrypted messages should not be stored for a long term.
 
 Details:
    During encryption ciper packs encrypted message and service information to the set of packages,
    which length is limited by maximim package length.
 
 Restrictions:
 Currently supported public/private keys:
    - Curve25519
 
 Minimum package length:
    - 113 bytes
